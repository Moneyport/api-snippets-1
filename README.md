# api-snippets

## Usage
Install the node dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Build version 1.0 of api snippets:

```bash
  npm run buildv1.0
```

## Questions

1) Are paths in the Mojaloop Specification considered "snippets"? Are they re-used widely across services?
2) Do we need to support both Swagger 2.0 and Open Api 3?
